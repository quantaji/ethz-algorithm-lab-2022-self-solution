# Algorithms Lab 2022 Self Solution

Each problem folder contains my solution, the problem PDF and the public test datasets. However, I don't have test environment in this repo. The PDFs may have my annotation and some small notes, so is the code. They might be misleading to you, so if you want to read the problem, you can choose to clear the annotation first.

**!!! IMPORTANT !!!**: Think twice before you browse to certain pages. There is a `README.md` in every problem folder that contains hints.

I am not familiar with C++. My codes go in the most naive way. You can try to accelerate then with some super cool C++ features, or some built-in functions that I don't know.
