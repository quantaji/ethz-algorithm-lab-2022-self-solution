# Algorithms Lab 2022 Self Solution

Each problem folder contains my solution, the problem PDF and the public test datasets. However, I don't have test environment in this repo. The PDFs may have my annotation and some small notes, so is the code. They might be misleading to you, so if you want to read the problem, you can choose to clear the annotation first.
